The foundations for a database is defining a Class and understanding instance data and methods.  A database is often a focus of backend coding as it will store persistent data, that can be recalled after the immediate session is closed.\n",

    "> The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a ***Class***  \n",
    "* In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an ***Object***. (a data structure).  An Object is used like many other Python variables.\n",
    "* A Class has ...\n",
    "    * a collection of data, these are called ***Attributes*** and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword ***self***\n",
    "    * a collection of Functions/Procedures.  These are called ***Methods** when they exist inside a Class definition.\n",
    "* An Object is created from the Class/Template.  Characteristics of objects ...\n",
    "   * an Object is an ***Instance*** of the Class/Template\n",
    "   * there can be many Objects created from the same Class\n",
    "   * each Object contains its own ***Instance Data***\n",
    "   * the data is setup by the ***Constructor***, this is the \"__init__\" method in a Python class\n",
    "   * all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using ***dot notation*** (object.method())\n",
    "* A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ...\n",
    "    * @property decorator (aka getter).  This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name())\n",
    "    * @name.setter decorator (aka setter).  This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = \"John\" versus object.set_name(\"John\"))\n",
    "    * observe all instance data (self._name, self._email ...) are prefixed with \"_\", this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...)"
