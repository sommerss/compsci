<p>Reflection: this gives me good insight about how specific and thorough I need to be. I need to assume that the person grading doesn’t know how the code works and I need to explain it to them as if they are trying to recreate it for themselves. Overall, This reminds me to be careful about my work and make sure that the video correlates with my written work. I also need the written work to be well organized so that it is easier to get credit.</p>
