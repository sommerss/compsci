            "content": "Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks. Algorithms that look similar often yield differnet outputs. To solve the same problem, many different algorithms can be used. . Therefore, algorithms are very important for programmers, and today we&#39;re going to explore how to determine the outcome of algorithms, how to deteremine the output of similar algorithms, how to edit existing algorithms, and how to develop our own algorithms. . Determine the outcome of algorithms . Consider the following algorithm. . def mystery(num, num2): if (num % num2 == 0): print(&quot;True&quot;) else: print(&quot;False&quot;) mystery(20, 4) . True . What does the algorithm do? Please explain in words. | This algorithm has two inputs. if num is divisible by num 2 it will print true. . What if I put in 30 as num and 4 as num2.

What is the output of this algorithm? it looks similar but the output is different! there is no else statement so it will print two of the statements (ex: 95 is also greater than 65) . temp = 95 if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;it is too hot outside&quot;) if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;i will go outside&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;it is too cold outside&quot;) . it is too hot outside i will go outside . Editing Algorithms . Task: Please edit the algorithm above to have it yield the same results as the previous algorithm! (no matter what temp you put in) . temp = 67 if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;it is too hot outside&quot;) if (temp &gt;= 65) and (temp &lt; 90): print(&quot;i will go outside&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;it is too cold outside&quot;) . i will go outside . Developing Algorithms . To develop algorithms, we first need to understand what the question is asking. Then, think about how you would approach it as a human and then try to find what pattern you went through to arrive at the answer. Apply this to code, and there you have it! An algorithm! . Let&#39;s say you wanted to sum up the first five integers. How would you do this in real life? Your thought process would probably be: . The sum of the first integer is 1. | Then, increase that integer by 1. I now add 2 to my existing sum (1). My new sum is 3. | Repeat until I add 5 to my sum. The resulting sum is 15. | . Now let&#39;s translate this into code. . sum = 0 # start with a sum of 0 for i in range (1, 6): # you will repeat the process five times for integers 1-5 sum = sum + i # add the number to your sum print(sum) # print the result . 15 . Task: Write an algorithm in python that sums up the first 5 odd integers. You can use the following code as a starter. . sum = 0 counter = 1 for i in range (0,5): sum = sum + counter counter = counter + 2 print(sum) . 25 . Homework . Create an algorithm that will start with any positive integer n and display the full sequence of numbers that result from the Collatz Conjecture. The COllatz Conjecture is as follows: . start with any positive integer | if the number is even, divide by 2 | if the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1 | repeat steps 2 and 3 until you reach 1 | Example: if the starting number was 6, the output would be 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 . n = 25 while n != 1: if (n % 2 == 0): n = int(n / 2) else: n = (n * 3) + 1 print(n) . 76 38 19 58 29 88 44 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1 .

You may use the template below as a framework for this assignment. . questions = [ #questions go here (remember to make them strings!) ] def questionloop(): pass #make an iterative function to ask the questions #this can be any loop you want as long as it works! def answercheck(): pass #make a function to check if the answer was correct or not . def qwp(prompt): print(&quot;question:&quot; + prompt) msg = input() return msg response = qwp(&quot;what is the append syntax for python?&quot;) if response == &quot;aList.append(value)&quot;: print(&quot;that&#39;s right!&quot;) else: print(&quot;boo unfortunately it was aList.append(value)&quot;) response = qwp(&quot;what can you use for automation?&quot;) if response == &quot;loops&quot;: print(&quot;that&#39;s right!&quot;) else: print(&quot;boo unfortunately it was loops&quot;) response = qwp(&quot;is copy pasting repeatedly professional?&quot;) if response == &quot;no&quot;: print(&quot;that&#39;s right!&quot;) else: print(&quot;boo unfortunately it was no&quot;) response = qwp(&quot;what do indexes normally count starting with?&quot;) if response == &quot;0&quot;: print(&quot;that&#39;s right!&quot;) else: print(&quot;boo unfortunately it was 0&quot;) response = qwp(&quot;can numbers in lists be used for math?&quot;) if response == &quot;yes&quot;: print(&quot;that&#39;s right!&quot;) else: print(&quot;boo unfortunately it was yes&quot;) . question:what is the append syntax for python? that&#39;s right! question:what can you use for automation? that&#39;s right! question:is copy pasting repeatedly professional? that&#39;s right! question:what do indexes normally count starting with? that&#39;s right! question:can numbers in lists be used for math? that&#39;s right! . Hacks . Here are some ideas of things you can do to make your program even cooler. Doing these will raise your grade if done correctly. . Add more than five questions with more than three answer choices | Randomize the order in which questions/answers are output | At the end, display the user&#39;s score and determine whether or not they passed | . Challenges . Important! You don&#39;t have to complete these challenges completely perfectly, but you will be marked down if you don&#39;t show evidence of at least having tried these challenges in the time we gave during the lesson. . 3.10 Challenge . Follow the instructions in the code comments. . grocery_list = [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;milk&#39;, &#39;oranges&#39;, &#39;carrots&#39;, &#39;cucumbers&#39;] # Print the fourth item in the list print(grocery_list[3]) # Now, assign the fourth item in the list to a variable, x and then print the variable x= grocery_list[3] print(x) # Add these two items at the end of the list : umbrellas and artichokes grocery_list.append(&quot;umbrellas&quot;) grocery_list.append(&quot;artichokes&quot;) # Insert the item eggs as the third item of the list grocery_list.insert(2, &quot;eggs&quot;) # Remove milk from the list grocery_list.remove(&quot;milk&quot;) # Assign the element at the end of the list to index 2. Print index 2 to check grocery_list[2] = grocery_list[6] print(grocery_list[2]) # Print the entire list, does it match ours ? print(grocery_list) # Expected output # carrots # carrots # artichokes # [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;artichokes&#39;, &#39;carrots&#39;, &#39;cucumbers&#39;, &#39;umbrellas&#39;, &#39;artichokes&#39;] . carrots carrots artichokes [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;artichokes&#39;, &#39;carrots&#39;, &#39;cucumbers&#39;, &#39;umbrellas&#39;, &#39;artichokes&#39;] . 3.8 Challenge . Create a loop that converts 8-bit binary values from the provided list into decimal numbers. Then, after the value is determined, remove all the values greater than 100 from the list using a list-related function you&#39;ve been taught before. Print the new list when done. . Once you&#39;ve done this with one of the types of loops discussed in this lesson, create a function that does the same thing with a different type of loop. . binarylist = [ &quot;01001001&quot;, &quot;10101010&quot;, &quot;10010110&quot;, &quot;00110111&quot;, &quot;11101100&quot;, &quot;11010001&quot;, &quot;10000001&quot; ] def binary_convert(binary): pass #use this function to convert every binary value in binarylist to decimal #afterward, get rid of the values that are greater than 100 in decimal #when done, print the results . def binarytoDec(n): decimalNum = [0] * n; i = 0; while (n &gt; 0): decimalNum[i] = n + 2; n = int(n / 2); i += 1; for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1): print(decimalNum[j], end = &quot;&quot;); n = &quot;01001001&quot;, &quot;10101010&quot;, &quot;10010110&quot;, &quot;00110111&quot;, &quot;11101100&quot;, &quot;11010001&quot;, &quot;10000001&quot;; binarytoDec(n); . TypeError Traceback (most recent call last) Cell In [14], line 20 16 print(decimalNum[j], end = &#34;&#34;); 19 n = &#34;01001001&#34;, &#34;10101010&#34;, &#34;10010110&#34;, &#34;00110111&#34;, &#34;11101100&#34;, &#34;11010001&#34;, &#34;10000001&#34;; &gt; 20 binarytoDec(n) Cell In [14], line 3, in binarytoDec(n) 1 def binarytoDec(n): -&gt; 3 decimalNum = [0] * n; 6 i = 0; 7 while (n &gt; 0): TypeError: can&#39;t multiply sequence by non-int of type &#39;tuple&#39; . I had a lot of trouble with this because I have converted binary to decimal before but never the other way around. I wasn&#39;t really sure where to start because I knew I needed to start with 2 for the binary, but I didn&#39;t know how to incorporate the whole list of values because I&#39;ve only converted one value at a time. .",

PYTHON . variables . represent a value with a variable- strings, lists, booleans, numbers determine the value of a variable by using an assignment . use equal sign to define a variable (with number, string, list, boolean) strings need quotations and lists need square brackets . you can use append for lists. mathematical functions can be performed on variables w numerical value . curly brackets and equal sign defines a dictionary . interchange variables by using a temporary variable . even function- can determine if variable is even or add- use variables with functions. use def to define function. . JAVASCRIPT . use var to assign variables using numbers can help with algabraic functions can also use const _ = value let __ = _ . can also use string (letters that form words) list contains multiple data points . console log connects to data abstraction- data points can be pulled from lists . DATA ABSTRACTION . provides seperation between abstract proprerties of a data type and the concrete details of its representation. manages complexity in programs by giving collection of data a name. makes it easier to implement, develop, maintain code. lists allow multiple related values to be treated as one value. . PYTHON . lists can be used to organize, maintain, develop related data . a list of students in a class would be under one variable- helps organize data and make less mistakes . you can further segregate a list using similar characteristics. you can also use this to organize data from apis and other resources. you can call and seperate and organize individual elements of a list by using a for loop split() splits a string into a list (default seperator is a white space) join() method takes all items iterable and joins them into a string. . albums = [ (&quot;Welcome to my Nightmare&quot;, &quot;Alice Cooper&quot;, 1975, # First album list [ (1, &quot;Welcome to my Nightmare&quot;), (2, &quot;Devil&#39;s Food&quot;), (3, &quot;The Black Widow&quot;), (4, &quot;Some Folks&quot;), (5, &quot;Only Women Bleed&quot;), ] ), (&quot;Bad Company&quot;, &quot;Bad Company&quot;, 1974, # Second album list [ (1, &quot;Can&#39;t Get Enough&quot;), (2, &quot;Rock Steady&quot;), (3, &quot;Ready for Love&quot;), (4, &quot;Don&#39;t Let Me Down&quot;), (5, &quot;Bad Company&quot;), (6, &quot;The Way I Choose&quot;), (7, &quot;Movin&#39; On&quot;), (8, &quot;Seagull&quot;), ] ), (&quot;Nightflight&quot;, &quot;Budgie&quot;, 1981, [ (1, &quot;I Turned to Stone&quot;), (2, &quot;Keeping a Rendezvous&quot;), (3, &quot;Reaper of the Glory&quot;), (4, &quot;She Used Me Up&quot;), ] ), (&quot;More Mayhem&quot;, &quot;Imelda May&quot;, 2011, [ (1, &quot;Pulling the Rug&quot;), (2, &quot;Psycho&quot;), (3, &quot;Mayhem&quot;), (4, &quot;Kentish Town Waltz&quot;), ] ), ] album_id = int(input(&quot;album?&quot;)) song_id = int(input(&quot;song?&quot;)) print(&quot;playing &quot;{0} &quot; from album &quot;{1} &quot;&quot;.format(albums[album_id-1][3][song_id-1][1],albums[album_id-1][0])) .

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language.

Python code that support Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD): https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/flask_portfolio/blob/main/model_jokes.py | . | . Hacks . Find and use an API as part of your project. An API and a little coding logic will be a big step toward getting meaningful data for a project. There are many API providers, find one that might work for your project to complete this hack. When picking an API you are looking for something that will work with either JavaScript Fetch or Python Request. Here are some samples, these are not qualified in any way. . RapidAPI- GitHub Project | No Key APIs Article | Twitter Developer | Google Developer | Reddit Developer | . Show API and format results in either Web Page or Jupyter Notebook. Ultimately, I will expect that we do APIs in backend (Python/Flask). However, for this Hack you can pick your preference. We will discuss pros and cons in next API tech talk. .",

What are some ways to (user) error proof this code? | The code should be able to calculate the cost of the meal of the user | . Hint: . write a “single” test describing an expectation of the program of the program | test - input burger, expect output of burger price | run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature | write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass | . Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work. . menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99} total = 0 #shows the user the menu and prompts them to select an item print(&quot;menu&quot;) for k,v in menu.items(): print(k + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) #why does v have &quot;str&quot; in front of it? #ideally the code should prompt the user multiple times item = input(&quot;Please select an item from the menu&quot;) #code should add the price of the menu items selected by the user print(&quot;total: $&quot; + str(menu[item])) . menu burger $3.99 fries $1.99 drink $0.99 total: $3.99 . Hacks . Now is a good time to think about Testing of your teams final project... . What errors may arise in your project? | What are some test cases that can be used? | Make sure to document any bugs you encounter and how you solved the problem. | What are “single” tests that you will perform on your project? Or, your part of the project? As Hack Design and Test plan action … Divide these “single” tests into Issues for Scrum Board prior to coding.

            "content": "to do list . week 1: friday: print out yearbook poster math worksheet and study for test update english notebook (hole punches) for check next week as well as on demand see week 1 comp sci requirements in notes section . by monday: finish comp sci req fix ups ( see notes section ) look at yearbook photo assignment, finish notebook for english and prepare for wednesday on demand, math worksheet, remake graffiti piece for art if wanted and make collage if wanted (can use paper in class so not necessary) . ALUMNI PANEL: aug 29 (write up for extra credit) . Colin, Anthony, Andrew, Mabel, Allison, Nitya, Bria . Questions: . How did you realize you wanted to do your major and how did this help: . Compare yourself to your classmates and your competitors, love of problem solving and creation (design of code), passion, opportunities for internships, necessary to learn programming for a lot of opportunities, can add on to other things that are non computer related and help w jobs (user interaction, etc), technical background necessary for many majors, apply to real world problems, . Biggest challenge with csp: . starting is difficult, keeping motivation is important (there IS a solution), clashing egos (following your own curve, just work on your own stuff and dont get caught up with what other people are doing), theory behind it (how it works, how its set up- hard transition from high school to college cs), having specific purposes to apply the comp sci to is helpful to try and learn, being patient and not getting frustrated with the syntax/logic (how you flowchart and think through the problems), temptation to make things up (dont cut corners or have things as a checkbox for points)- going above and beyond solves more problems, dont just gun for points-, getting started in a new area of comp sci is difficult because its full of a lot of pieces so you really just have to get started (the plan isnt that important) . PBL scenarios in my computer science class Not as many opportunities, so make the most of every experience (use scrum methodology, make mistakes, talk to peers daily), project based learning classes wont go away so it will be a good chance to learn, A mix of tests and PBL (project based learning), could be fairly balanced depending on college (Important part of compsci especially at upper division courses at the UCs), working with other people is important for understanding- important to understand that some classes are structured and some are not (freeloaders) so you can find out how best to study and make it efficient and etc to fit my personal needs, ask questions . Have you applied CS in your major if you are not majoring in it? . Menial tasks are made easier with scripts (copy pastes, etc), coding is everywhere and can serve for any assignments, advanced calculations made easier with coding (lots of opportunities for use), can use code as a substitute for other things to make them faster and easier (optimizing), problem solving logic, very helpful for math courses and specific math sites/libraries/tools/etc, can use jupyter for technical papers and stuff, applicable for basically every class (including psychology and etc) . Jobs at school/professors Important to create resume (first requirement to apply for jobs)- push yourself to be above and beyond and talk to teachers and etc- what sets you apart? start leaving breadcrumb trail now so you can start referecing how you differentiate yourself, internship at northrup grumman, lecturer, interact with professor and ask if there is space in lab for you (such as UCSD robotics lab), teachers assistants, code ninjas, first year at northrup wiring diagrams, second year visualizing flight data (everything we are doing in csp), cybersecurity third year, working with APIs and web development, javascript, html, python, flight data website (website hooked to previously existing database), scripting for contracts (project out staffing to make sure everyone has adequate work), NORTHROP GRUMMAN INTERNSHIP PROGRAM FOR JUNIORS AND SENIORS (20 students county wide), bigger projects the more years you do, machine learning with professor at UCSD . Personal projects/etc balance between what you want to do and school (important to have personal projects to show you understand something before you have work experiece) 2-3 to see that they know what you can do, can be easy doesnt have to be deep, app finding algorithms, tsps (traveling salesman problem), data visualization is a big field, opportunities in mechanical engineering, manipulation of commands, material simulations done by hands that you have to convert into actual function you can run, set up server and etc, Triton AI UCSD robotics club (do autonomous car things- made by Northrup Grumman and navy ocean surveillance), cognitive science is an opportunity to have varied interactions with different things, organizational skills important (featheralist, etc) . resume- knowing when to apply (lots hiring in sept or nov a year before), resume done by early september or mid nov is best- proof of work youve done, engineering is the same regardless of what school you go to, so personal projects important because it sets you apart from the other students with same major, better gpa, etc, ask local/smaller companies (some take high school interns), find things you are interested in, BIOTECH, OCEAN THINGS, etc, networking is most important (know people who can refer you), talk to people, use LinkedIn, referrals really helpful, code ninjas internship hiring and you dont need that much experience as long as they know youre good with kids .",

ADDED UNDER JOHN AND SUNNY, SECTION TWO OF NOTEBOOK) instead of index, dictionary looks for key, so if you want to get key value use square brackets to find what the value is in that dictionary for loop means itll run every time theres something in the dictionary until everything shows up d_rec is location in the dictionary rec is like an index, itll go until it finds all the records goes through each database for first thing to find and loops until everything is done other iteration types: while loops- while number is less than length itll check for whatever is left, same idea for recursive loop (value less than length to find things), hacks at bottom . august 30 week 2 . html fragments . -background creation of html in whatever markdown we are doing -defining pieces of html tags like meta title etc lots of alligator brackets slash to end script reason markdown changes to html is because of jekyll (converts when posted) can use for tables (table to table with alligator bracket and slash) can use supported themes in github and replace it in config yaml (change it back after to avoid issues)(hacks) in nav frontend there is an example of a table .",
