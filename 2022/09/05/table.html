I did not think that the student should earn any points for this category because the answer was incredibly nonspecific and barely described the program at all. Collegeboard agreed.
</td>
<td>
I did not think they deserved the point because what they were describing wasn’t even being used in the code (AnimalList) so it made no sense to provide an explanation of it. Collegeboard agreed.
</td>
<td>
I did not think this category deserved the point because there is no code segment managing complexity and (subsequently) there is no explanation of how the code manages complexity, which is the entire premise of this section. Collegeboard agreed.
</td>
<td>
I did not think the student deserved points for this because there was only one parameter named guess instead of the two that are necessary and the functionality description does not give a “so what?” (why it matters for the rest of the program functioning). Collegeboard agreed.
</td>
<td>
I did not think the student deserved points for this because while there was iteration, sequencing, and selection, the description was vague and hard to follow. Collegeboard agreed.
</td>
<td>
I thought the student deserved points for this because it was specific and showed two calls as well as a parameter and what was tested by each individual call and the results of the calls. It describes the conditions and differing results. Collegeboard agreed with my analysis.

I thought the student deserved points for this because everything was described very thoroughly and the video is effectively connected with the written response. Collegeboard also awarded the student with a 1.

I thought that the person deserved the point for this category. It talks about managing complexity and how the code NEEDS this complexity managed in order to be efficient.
</td>

I think the person deserved the points for this because it had more parameters than were even required and gives a good description of functionality.
</td>

They deserve the point for this because there was sequencing, selection, and iteration and the algorithm is described in extreme detail so it is definitely possible for it to be recreated by someone else. Collegeboard agreed.

<p>Reflection: this gives me good insight about how specific and thorough I need to be. I need to assume that the person grading doesn’t know how the code works and I need to explain it to them as if they are trying to recreate it for themselves. Overall, This reminds me to be careful about my work and make sure that the video correlates with my written work. I also need the written work to be well organized so that it is easier to get credit.</p>
