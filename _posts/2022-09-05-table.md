    <td>I thought that the student should earn a one because the descriptions were fairly detailed and specific about what the program was for and exactly what it did. College board disagreed and found the description of the purpose of the program to be nondescript and not specific enough to earn the point.</td>
    <td>The list has more than one element and aids in the programs purpose. The description is specific and meets all of the criteria, which collegeboard agrees with and would also award the student 1 point. </td> 
    <td>I thought the student should not recieve points for the third segment because it does not show how the program manages complexity and just explained the code. Collegeboard agreed with my analysis and said that the student did not meet any of the criteria appropriately.</td> 
    <td>I thought this deserved deserved the point for this because the procedure was called twice and explained thoroughly with results of the calls. Collegeboard agreed with my analysis. </td> 
    <td>I thought the student deserved points for this because they iterated and sequenced the program and selected specific values which they called. Collegeboard agreed with my analysis.</td>
    <td>I thought the student deserved points for this because it was specific and showed two calls as well as a parameter and what was tested by each individual call and the results of the calls. Collegeboard agreed with my analysis.</td>

    <td>The student uses code and justifies the list, meaning I think they deserve the point. Collegeboard agrees with my analysis.</td> 
    <td>I thought this deserved deserved the point for this because the procedure was called twice and explained thoroughly with results of the calls/ the functionality of the procedure. Collegeboard agreed with my analysis. </td> 
    <td>I thought the student deserved points for this because they iterated and sequenced the program and selected specific values which they called. It gives enough description that it can be recreated. Collegeboard agreed with my analysis.</td>
    <td>I thought the student deserved points for this because it was specific and showed two calls as well as a parameter and what was tested by each individual call and the results of the calls. It describes the conditions and differing results. Collegeboard agreed with my analysis.</td>

    <td>I did not think that the student should earn any points for this category because the answer was incredibly nonspecific and barely described the program at all. Collegeboard agreed. </td>
    <td>I did not think they deserved the point because what they were describing wasn't even being used in the code (AnimalList) so it made no sense to provide an explanation of it. Collegeboard agreed. </td> 
    <td>I did not think this category deserved the point because there is no code segment managing complexity and (subsequently) there is no explanation of how the code manages complexity, which is the entire premise of this section. Collegeboard agreed. </td> 
    <td>I did not think the student deserved points for this because there was only one parameter named guess instead of the two that are necessary and the functionality description does not give a "so what?" (why it matters for the rest of the program functioning). Collegeboard agreed.  </td>
    <td>I did not think the student deserved points for this because while there was iteration, sequencing, and selection, the description was vague and hard to follow. Collegeboard agreed. </td>
    <td>I thought the student deserved points for this because it was specific and showed two calls as well as a parameter and what was tested by each individual call and the results of the calls. It describes the conditions and differing results. Collegeboard agreed with my analysis.</td>

    <td>I thought the student deserved points for this because everything was described very thoroughly and the video is effectively connected with the written response. Collegeboard also awarded the student with a 1.   </td>

    <td>I thought that the person deserved the point for this category. It talks about managing complexity and how the code NEEDS this complexity managed in order to be efficient. </td> 
    <td>I think the person deserved the points for this because it had more parameters than were even required and gives a good description of functionality. </td>
    <td>They deserve the point for this because there was sequencing, selection, and iteration and the algorithm is described in extreme detail so it is definitely possible for it to be recreated by someone else. Collegeboard agreed. </td>

    <td>I thought the person should earn the point for this because the conditions being tested and the results were described, but collegeboard disagreed because it gives the conditions being tested instead of 2 distinct arguments.</td>
