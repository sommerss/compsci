### Hacks

I am very grateful for Ms. Philyaw on the Del Norte campus. Ms Philyaw, an honors english teacher, is very accomodating in terms of extensions and opportunities to finish work when your schedule is particularly busy. Her projects are easily comprehensible and she is available very often for help on anything that students need. Her classroom is a safe space and she goes to great lengths to make her students feel comfortable. All of her courses allow students to achieve a higher understanding of english while also providing less stress. 

### my original takeaways from the video

it is important to be grateful for what you have and what you are currently experiencing in order to make the most of your life and increase your general quality of life. It can be difficult to manage your time well and set yourself on a good course and take initiative for your own life, but it is important to do these things in order to minimize negative consequences and to maximize your potential. 

### Hacks

Students who took more initiative and took control of their own learning were generally more successful in achieving higher scores. This can be used in my group this year because in order to get the optimal five on the exam, we can work harder and do more than just the course content to propel ourselves farther towards success. 

### Collaboration video takeaways


collaboration is important for well rounded, well thought out software creation. not only does it allow for better products, it makes the process easier and more streamlined. incorporating perspectives from diverse backgrounds and even users can make the product the most successful and well developed it can be. 

### Hacks

my group has a variety of diverse backgrounds and opportunities for collaboration. none of us knew each other previously, offering a good opportunity for different opinions.
