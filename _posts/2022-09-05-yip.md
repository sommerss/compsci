## VOCAB 

Unit 2… Binary/Data Terms
---------------
Bits- smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store  Bytes- a unit of data that is eight binary digits long
Hexadecimal - base/positional number system
Nibbles- four consecutive binary digits/ half of an 8 byte (aka a half-byte)
Binary Numbers: 
Unsigned Integer: dont have a + or - associated with them
 Signed Integer: pos or neg
 Floating Point: pos or neg whole number with a decimal point 
Binary Data Abstractions: 
Boolean: logical data type that can only have true or false values
ASCII : american standard code for information interchange- standard data coding format for electronic communication between computers
Unicode: universal character representation of standard for text in computer processing
RGB: system for representing colors used on a computer display
Data Compression: 
Lossy, Lossless (note discussed yet)
Unit 3… Algorithm/Programming Terms
-------------------
Variables : abstract storing location paired with a symbolic name 
Data Types: set of possible values and a set of allowed operations
Assignment Operators: operator used to assign a new value to a variable, property, event, indexer element 
Managing Complexity with Variables:
Lists: sequence of several variables grouped together under a single name
2D Lists: collection of data cells, all of same type, can be given single name- but a 2d one is organized as a matrix with a number of rows and columns
Dictionaries: abstract data type that defines an unordered collection of data as a set of key-value pairs
Class: blueprint/ definition of an object
Algorithms: a list set of instructions, used to solve problems or perform tasks
Sequence: first programming construct executed one after another
Selection: programming construct where a section of code is run only if a condition is met
Iteration: function that repeats a block of code in a specified order, often until a specific result occurs
Expressions: particular concept in which a number of variables or constants and operators and functions are put together in a single statement that is acted out 
Comparison Operators: usd to compare the values within an expression 
Booleans Expressions and Selection: true or false, compare data of any type as long as types are the same and see if greater than, less than, or equal to other data
Booleans Expressions and Iteration: and or and not
Truth Tables: way of summarizing and checking the logic of a circuit
Characters: display unit of information equivalent to one alphabetic letter or symbol
Strings: a sequence of characters (literal constant or some kind of variable)
Length: number of words/letters in a sequence, string, etc
Concatenation: joining two strings together
Upper: upper bounds of an operation
Lower: lower bounds of an operation
Traversing Strings: accessing all the elements of the string one after the other by using the subscript
Python If: used to eecute the true part and false part of a given condition
 Elif: else if: give two options (for conditional if statement)
 Else conditionals: else to specify a block of code to be executed
 Nested Selection Statements: used when more than one decision must be made before carrying out a task- one program block is placed inside other program block of the same operation type
Python For: control flow statement used to repeatedly execute a group of statements as long as the condition is satisfied
 While loops with Range: loop that iterates through the code specified in its body
 with List: iterates through just a list specified
Procedural Abstraction: when we write code sections which are generalised by having variable parameters
Python Def procedures: procedures allow us to group a block of code under a name known as a procedure name
 Parameters: special kind of variable used in a function to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the function
 Return Values: value that a function returns to the claling script or function when it completes its task
