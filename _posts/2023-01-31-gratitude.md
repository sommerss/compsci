title: tri 2 mcq corrections

score: 40/50

corrections:

Q28 Robot in bottom right corner of grid: I chose option b, which was incorrect, instead of option c, which was correct. Option B would have had the robot facing the wrong direction and going the incorrect number of spaces forward. 

Q30 Drawcircle: I accidentally only selected one answer instead of two. 

Q33 Find maximum value algorithms: I put that they both work correctly all the time, but algorithm one actually only works under specific conditions.

Q34 Binary search on a list of 500 elements: I put 500 elements because I assumed it would check them all, but I forgot binary search is meant to be very efficient, so the real answer was 10. 

Q37 Drawing lines between dots: I put D, but only the first command matches and the second does not, making the answer B.

Q38 Result of mystery procedure: I put that it returns true when the initial value is 2, but in actuality it returns true when the initial value of number is even because my option would have returned true, not false. 

Q39 Robot in maze: I said that number 2 was right, but it was actually 3 because I misread the second number on the second move and turn

Q41 Simulating election votes: I accidentally only picked one answer instead of two.

Q45 Benefits of a heuristic solution: I picked a, but it makes more sense that the problem would need to be solved heuristically if it could not be solved in a realistic amount of time

Q50: I picked L, but it should have been V because 56 is much further along in the alphabet. 

Reflection: All of my mistakes could have been easily fixed if I spent more time reading over the questions. In the future, I will make sure to spend more time on each question to achieve the maximum possible score.
