## blog post

1. digital media production: the outside presentation wasn't expcted but interesting. the designs had a smooth quality I wasn't expecting and the actual products were really high quality for a starter class.

2. ceramics: really interesting diverse projects like an octopus and a grape jar. a lot of time was clearly put into the stuff. different than i remember when i took the class. there was a really detailed anatomically correct heart which seems like it was really difficult to make.

3. csp a: a ton of people in the classroom, but all of the coders seemed really invested and passionate, especially brias group for the clothing website

4. ap studio art: the walk arund was a little obnocious but the art was really textured and i wasnt expecting some of it to be as 3d as it was. the artists are really talented and it seems like professional work and i really admire their skill. there was also ceramis which i wasnt expecting and it was really detailed with skulls and mushrooms. there was also a cool dolphin lamp.

5. d+p: really diverse takes on projects and lots of different colors. nicely arranged room and really vibrant art that clearly took a lot of effort.
