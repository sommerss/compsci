</ul><p>to do list</p>

<p>week 1: friday:
print out yearbook poster
math worksheet and study for test
update english notebook (hole punches) for check next week as well as on demand
see week 1 comp sci requirements in notes section</p>

<p>by monday: finish comp sci req fix ups ( see notes section )
look at yearbook photo assignment, finish notebook for english and prepare for wednesday on demand, math worksheet, remake graffiti piece for art if wanted and make collage if wanted (can use paper in class so not necessary)</p>

<p>ALUMNI PANEL: aug 29 (write up for extra credit)</p>

<p>Colin, Anthony, Andrew, Mabel, Allison, Nitya, Bria</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<p>How did you realize you wanted to do your major and how did this help:</p>

<p>Compare yourself to your classmates and your competitors, love of problem solving and creation (design of code), passion, opportunities for internships, necessary to learn programming for a lot of opportunities, can add on to other things that are non computer related and help w jobs (user interaction, etc), technical background necessary for many majors, apply to real world problems,</p>

<p>Biggest challenge with csp:</p>

<p>starting is difficult, keeping motivation is important (there IS a solution), clashing egos (following your own curve, just work on your own stuff and dont get caught up with what other people are doing), theory behind it (how it works, how its set up- hard transition from high school to college cs), having specific purposes to apply the comp sci to is helpful to try and learn, being patient and not getting frustrated with the syntax/logic (how you flowchart and think through the problems), temptation to make things up (dont cut corners or have things as a checkbox for points)- going above and beyond solves more problems, dont just gun for points-, getting started in a new area of comp sci is difficult because its full of a lot of pieces so you really just have to get started (the plan isnt that important)</p>

<p>PBL scenarios in my computer science class
Not as many opportunities, so make the most of every experience (use scrum methodology, make mistakes, talk to peers daily), project based learning classes wont go away so it will be a good chance to learn, A mix of tests and PBL (project based learning), could be fairly balanced depending on college (Important part of compsci especially at upper division courses at the UCs), working with other people is important for understanding- important to understand that some classes are structured and some are not (freeloaders) so you can find out how best to study and make it efficient and etc to fit my personal needs, ask questions</p>

<p>Have you applied CS in your major if you are not majoring in it?</p>

<p>Menial tasks are made easier with scripts (copy pastes, etc), coding is everywhere and can serve for any assignments, advanced calculations made easier with coding (lots of opportunities for use), can use code as a substitute for other things to make them faster and easier (optimizing), problem solving logic, very helpful for math courses and specific math sites/libraries/tools/etc, can use jupyter for technical papers and stuff, applicable for basically every class (including psychology and etc)</p>

<p>Jobs at school/professors
Important to create resume (first requirement to apply for jobs)- push yourself to be above and beyond and talk to teachers and etc- what sets you apart? start leaving breadcrumb trail now so you can start referecing how you differentiate yourself, internship at northrup grumman, lecturer, interact with professor and ask if there is space in lab for you (such as UCSD robotics lab), teachers assistants, code ninjas, first year at northrup wiring diagrams, second year visualizing flight data (everything we are doing in csp), cybersecurity third year, working with APIs and web development, javascript, html, python, flight data website (website hooked to previously existing database), scripting for contracts (project out staffing to make sure everyone has adequate work), NORTHROP GRUMMAN INTERNSHIP PROGRAM FOR JUNIORS AND SENIORS (20 students county wide), bigger projects the more years you do, machine learning with professor at UCSD</p>

<p>Personal projects/etc
balance between what you want to do and school (important to have personal projects to show you understand something before you have work experiece) 2-3 to see that they know what you can do, can be easy doesnt have to be deep, app finding algorithms, tsps (traveling salesman problem), data visualization is a big field, opportunities in mechanical engineering, manipulation of commands, material simulations done by hands that you have to convert into actual function you can run, set up server and etc, Triton AI UCSD robotics club (do autonomous car things- made by Northrup Grumman and navy ocean surveillance), cognitive science is an opportunity to have varied interactions with different things, organizational skills important (featheralist, etc)</p>

<p>resume- knowing when to apply (lots hiring in sept or nov a year before), resume done by early september or mid nov is best- proof of work youve done, engineering is the same regardless of what school you go to, so personal projects important because it sets you apart from the other students with same major, better gpa, etc, ask local/smaller companies (some take high school interns), find things you are interested in, BIOTECH, OCEAN THINGS, etc, networking is most important (know people who can refer you), talk to people, use LinkedIn, referrals really helpful, code ninjas internship hiring and you dont need that much experience as long as they know youre good with kids</p>
