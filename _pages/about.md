This website is powered by fastpages and also me, Sabine. I put a lot of work into this. I am equally as passionate about music I like, so here is a drop down list of music I am interested in at the moment. I also like saying yippee. 🦂 🦂 
1. Mount Everest-Labrinth
2. N Side- Steve Lacy
3. Cold Cold Cold- Cage the Elephant
4. Boomerang- Jojo Siwa (just kidding)
5. Starboy- The Weeknd ( ͡❛ ͜ʖ ͡❛)
